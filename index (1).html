        <h1>Cloud Automation</h1>
        <p>Cloud automation refers to the implementation of tools and processes in an effort to reduce the manual
            intervention associated with provisioning, configuring, and managing public, private, and hybrid cloud
            environments. Get a free assessment. See our cloud performance solutions.</p>
        <div class="features">
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Security</b></li>
                <p>Security is protection from, or resilience against, potential harm. Beneficiaries of security may be
                    persons and social groups, objects and institutions, ecosystems, or any other entity or phenomenon
                    vulnerable to unwanted change.</p>
                <li><b>Scalability and flexibility</b></li>
                <p>Scalability and Flexibility. Rather than manually scaling cloud resources up and down, automation
                    tools
                    do all the hard work for you.</p>
                <li><b>Automated provisioning</b></li>
                <p>Provisioning infrastructure with automated tools—for example, automation saves time when configuring
                    multiple virtual servers. You can use an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) cloud automation tool to
                    create
                    templates defining and applying each server’s configuration. This approach works for other cloud
                    resources, including networking and storage volumes. IaC tools are especially suited to the cloud,
                    with
                    cloud vendors often providing vendor-specific solutions.</p>
                <li><b>Software Testing</b></li>
                <p>Software testing is the act of checking whether software satisfies expectations. Software testing can
                    provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and the risk of its failure
                    to
                    a user or sponsor.</p>
            </ul>

            <h2>5 Types</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Resource allocation</b></li>
                <p>Autoscaling -- the ability to scale up and down the use of compute, memory or networking resources to
                    match
                    demand -- is a core tenet of cloud computing. It provides elasticity in resource usage and enables
                    the
                    pay-as-you-go cloud cost model.</p>
                <li><b>Configurations</b></li>
                <p>Infrastructure configurations can be defined through templates and code and implemented
                    automatically. In
                    the
                    cloud, opportunities for integration increase with associated cloud services.</p>
                <li><b>Development and deployment</b></li>
                <p>Continuous software development relies upon automation for various steps, from code scans and version
                    control
                    to testing and deployment.</p>
                <li><b>Tagging</b></li>
                <p>Assets can be tagged automatically based on specific criteria, context and conditions of operation.
                </p>
                <li><b>Security</b></li>
                <p>Cloud environments can be set up with automated security controls that enable or restrict access to
                    apps
                    or
                    data, and scan for vulnerabilities and unusual performance levels.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="benefits">
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cost Savings</b></li>
                <p>Cloud automation reduces errors and increases productivity, which translates to lower operational
                    costs.
                    Automating time-consuming and error-prone tasks reduces the time IT staff spend putting out
                    fires
                    and
                    allows them to focus on revenue-generating tasks that target the company’s goals.

                    Automation also helps you to reduce or eliminate the costs associated with training IT personnel
                    to
                    install, troubleshoot, and maintain resources in the cloud environment.</p>
                <li><b>Easier Configuration Management</b></li>
                <p>Manually maintaining a large modern IT system can be resource-intensive, leading to increased
                    risks
                    due
                    to errors. Configuration management ensures that the configuration of your systems and software
                    are
                    current and correct.

                    Cloud automation improves efficiency by replacing manual configuration processes with automated
                    processes, making it possible to manage more cloud resources with less human oversight. With
                    automated
                    configuration management, you can ensure that cloud resources are always in a known, consistent
                    state.</p>
                <li><b>Faster, More Reliable Services</b></li>
                <p>Cloud automation allows you to continue to deliver faster, more reliable services to your
                    customers
                    as your company grows. It makes it easier to provision the resources and infrastructure you need
                    to
                    jump on a new business opportunity or quickly change business direction to address evolving
                    customer
                    needs.

                    As you improve current services or products and introduce new ones, you can seamlessly scale
                    resources to support new infrastructure without disrupting the customer experience.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Getting Decision-Makers On Board With Automation</b></li>
                <p>Challenges may arise before you even start using automation at your organization. That’s
                    because
                    you may
                    have difficulty convincing the senior members of the organization that using automation is
                    the
                    right
                    move. That’s crucial if some or all of those parties have direct influence over whether or
                    not
                    you have
                    the financial resources needed to make automation work.

                    Successfully navigating this struggle could mean providing case studies that indicate how a
                    company
                    similar to yours saved money, enjoyed more productive employees or saw other benefits after
                    giving the
                    nod of approval to automation. You can also point out that there are ways to see fast
                    returns on
                    investment through automation.</p>
                <li><b>Not Choosing An Automation Strategy For Your Business Type</b></li>
                <p>Some companies only think of deploying automation in a non-specific way. They don’t research
                    thoroughly
                    enough to determine the best ways to apply automation to their respective industries.
                    Process
                    automation
                    started in manufacturing but has since progressed to other sectors, including health care
                    and
                    retail. If
                    you only think about using automation in a general sense, that’s likely a mistake.

                    The better approach to take is first to identify the pain points experienced by your
                    company.
                    Then, dig
                    deeper and see how other entities in your industry solved those through automation.</p>
                <li><b>Failing To Use Metrics That Assess The Company’s Progress Towards Goals</b></li>
                <p>Setting goals associated with your automation plans is essential. But don’t stop there. You
                    must
                    also
                    determine which statistics you’ll use to check whether you’re making headway in meeting
                    those
                    milestones. The metrics to choose will vary depending on your goals. That’s why you should
                    take
                    the time
                    to decide which metrics to track, then how often to do it.

                    Be aware that there’s sometimes a learning curve to overcome. You may get disappointing
                    results
                    if you
                    start to measure improvements only a month after implementation, for example.

                    If you keep an eye on metrics frequently enough, however, automation can make apparent
                    fixable
                    issues in
                    your process workflows. Think about looking at metrics twice a year and committing to take
                    corrective
                    action after seeing things that hamper progress.</p>

                            network
                            and storage elements.

                            In essence, server provisioning can include all the operations required to set up a new

                        <li><b>User provisioning</b></li>
                        <p>Provisioning a user refers to granting them permission to services and applications
                            within a
                            corporate environment, such as a database, corporate email system, or network. Often,
                            these
                            permissions are granted based on the user’s role or job title.

                            An example of user provisioning is role-based access control (RBAC). Similarly,
                            CloudZero
                            offers users three different views of cloud costs, based on their roles, including
